                <p>Hello, I am William. I am a Staff Scientist at <a href="https://www.ara.com/" target="_blank">Applied Research Associates</a>. 
                    My work focuses on maximizing intelligence and information from images. 
                    The emphasis of my work is the flexibility of systems and algorithms through deployment on different platforms from SBC's to servers.</p>
                <p>Prior to joining ARA, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees from the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a> in Mechanical Engineering (2023 and 2021). 
                    As a graduate student my research focuses were 3D mapping and mobile manipulation with an emphasis on reducing operator setup and difficulty.
                    I enjoy running, biking, climbing, and anything that gets me outside into nature.</p>
                
                <p> <strong> Research </strong></p>
                <p>I have worked on a range of projects related to robotics and my expertise is in applied robotics based on a theoretical background. 
                    The aim of my research and work is to increase the usability of robotic / technical systems by reducing the entry barrier for non-experts seeking to leverage emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>I enjoy the hands on interactions for both myself and robotic systems. 
                    There is nothing better than getting a robot to interact with the real world through seeing and moving just like we do.
                    From mechantronics to robot design to computer vision to motion planning, through my experiences with different organizations and projects I have worked and studied many aspects of robotics to develop a wide variety of skills.</p>
